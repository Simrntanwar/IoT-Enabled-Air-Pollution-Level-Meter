Code Files -

1) adcsinglechannel - 

We used the following code files for obtaining the raw adc input values from each of the 3 sensors and callibrating them to ppm. 
- adcsinglechannel.c - main project file
- adcsinglechannel.sysconfig - the system configuration file to allot the ADC channels to each sensor. Its an inbuilt feature of simplelink boards.
- README - Overview of whats there in the project
- Other files - Dependencies


2) httpget -

We built upon this sample code to transfer the sensor data via http protocol over wifi to the blynk server. This code also has a function of adcsinglechannel to obtain the sensor values.
- httpget.c - main project file containing the sequence for httpget protocol and also contains thread URI used for uploading the data to blynk server. It also has a separate function for collection data via 3 adc channels.
- platform.c - File for netwrok connection via WiFi. Contains details of SSID, security type and security key.
- httpget.sysconfig - the system configuration file to allot the ADC channels to each sensor and other hardware required for WiFi connectivity. Its an inbuilt feature of simplelink boards.
